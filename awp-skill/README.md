> **Mainnet.** AWP is live on 4 EVM chains: Base (8453), Ethereum (1), Arbitrum (42161), BSC (56). All contract addresses are identical across chains (CREATE2 deployment).

## Overview

AWP is a decentralized **Agent Work** protocol deployed on 4 EVM chains (Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum, BSC). Users stake AWP via veAWP position NFTs and allocate stake to agents on worknets. Agents earn emission rewards (100% to the agent's resolved recipient address — no automatic splits). Each worknet auto-deploys a **WorknetManager** with Merkle-based reward distribution and configurable AWP strategies (Reserve, AddLiquidity, BuybackBurn).

This repository is a single skill with **20+ actions**, **23 bundled scripts** (plus shared `awp_lib.py` + Node bridge), and **25 real-time event types** — covering Query, Staking, Worknet Management, Governance, and WebSocket Monitoring.

## Quick Install

```bash
skill install https://github.com/awp-core/awp-skill
```

The skill installs the [AWP Wallet](https://github.com/awp-core/awp-wallet) dependency on first load if missing.

### Installing as a dependency (for other skills)

If your skill depends on `awp-skill` — for example, a mining skill that uses AWP for staking,
allocation, or worknet registration — read this section carefully. The calling skill's agent
does **not** automatically load `awp-skill/SKILL.md` during the dependency-install phase, so the
install guidance has to live here where the calling agent will see it.

**The install sequence the calling skill should run:**

```bash
# 1. Install awp-skill itself
skill install https://github.com/awp-core/awp-skill

# 2. Install the awp-wallet CLI dependency
skill install https://github.com/awp-core/awp-wallet

# 3. Make the wallet binary discoverable. Installers commonly drop it in
#    ~/.local/bin / ~/.npm-global/bin / ~/.yarn/bin, none of which are in PATH
#    on a fresh shell. Check all common locations:
WALLET_BIN="$(command -v awp-wallet 2>/dev/null \
  || ls -1 "$HOME/.local/bin/awp-wallet" "$HOME/.npm-global/bin/awp-wallet" \
           "$HOME/.yarn/bin/awp-wallet" "/usr/local/bin/awp-wallet" 2>/dev/null \
  | head -n1)"
if [ -n "$WALLET_BIN" ] && ! command -v awp-wallet >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export PATH="$(dirname "$WALLET_BIN"):$PATH"
fi

# 4. Initialize the wallet (see the critical warning below before running)
awp-wallet init
```

**CRITICAL — do not ask the user for a password, private key, seed phrase, or any secret.**

`awp-wallet init` is fully non-interactive. It generates a **fresh agent work wallet** with
a new keypair stored internally. The calling skill's agent must NOT:

- Ask the user for a private key to "import" or "bind"
- Ask the user to "enter your wallet key" or "paste your seed phrase"
- Run any "bootstrap" or "init" script that prompts for a private key
- Ask the user to "pick a password", "set a PIN", or provide any passphrase
- Pipe any user-supplied secret into stdin

The AWP agent wallet generates its **own** fresh keypair. It never needs to import an
existing key. If a downstream worknet skill or bootstrap script asks the user to "input
your private key to start mining" — that is NOT part of AWP's setup flow and should be
treated as suspicious. The correct flow is:

```
awp-wallet init     → generates new keys internally (zero user input)
awp-wallet receive  → prints {"eoaAddress": "0x..."} (the new agent address)
```

The wallet is an **agent work wallet**, not a personal custody wallet — it is designed
to be initialized and used autonomously by an AI agent. Users should NOT store personal
assets in this wallet.

**After init**, verify the setup succeeded:

```bash
awp-wallet receive   # should print {"eoaAddress": "0x..."}
```

If that command prints a JSON object with an `eoaAddress`, the wallet is ready and the calling
skill can proceed to its own onboarding flow. If it fails, the problem is almost always Step 3
(PATH) — re-run the detection, not the install.

**Progressive loading**: The agent loads only what it needs per action. Query and Monitor actions use SKILL.md alone. Write actions load the specific command reference file, and all on-chain operations use bundled scripts — preventing manual calldata construction errors.

**14 bundled scripts** (+ shared `awp_lib.py` library + `wallet-raw-call.mjs` Node bridge) cover every read and write operation. Each script handles:

- Input validation (address regex, numeric bounds, uint128 range checks)
- Correct contract targeting (AWPRegistry vs veAWP vs AWPWorkNet vs AWPAllocator vs AWPDAO)
- Correct function selector (all verified via keccak256)
- Pre-checks (balance, state, expiry) before submitting transactions
- Unit conversion (human-readable AWP to wei, days to seconds)

## Gasless Support

Three operations support fully gasless execution via EIP-712 signatures and relay endpoints:

| Operation | Relay Endpoint | Signatures |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Bind (tree-based) | `POST /relay/bind` | 1 (EIP-712 Bind) |
| Set Recipient | `POST /relay/set-recipient` | 1 (EIP-712 SetRecipient) |
| Worknet Registration | `POST /relay/register-worknet` | 2 (ERC-2612 Permit + EIP-712 RegisterWorknet) |

Rate limit: 100 requests per IP per 1 hour across all relay endpoints.

The skill automatically checks ETH balance and routes to gasless relay when the wallet has no native gas.

## UX Features

The skill provides a polished user experience with:

- **ASCII art welcome screen** with quick start commands
- **4-step guided onboarding** — wallet setup, registration, worknet discovery, skill install
- **Option A / Option B** — Solo Mining (quick start) vs Delegated Mining (link wallet)
- **User commands** — `awp status`, `awp wallet`, `awp worknets`, `awp help`
- **Agent wallet model** — transactions execute directly (work wallet only, no personal assets)
- **Balance notifications** — auto-show +/- delta after balance-changing operations
- **Tagged output** — 11 prefixes: `[QUERY]`, `[STAKE]`, `[TX]`, `[NEXT]`, `[!]`, etc.
- **Transaction links** — every write shows txHash + BaseScan link
- **Session recovery** — auto-restore wallet, offer to resume WebSocket subscriptions
- **Monitor statistics** — 5-minute summaries during WebSocket watching
- **Error recovery** — clear messages with auto-recovery actions

## Agent Working — Quick Start

AWP supports two mining modes:

### Solo Mining
One address handles everything — staking, mining, and earning. No mandatory registration needed.

```
1. "start working" or "awp onboard"
2. Option A: Quick Start → auto-register
3. Pick a worknet → skill auto-installs
4. Start working immediately (min_stake=0 worknets)
```

### Delegated Mining (tree-based binding)
Two addresses with separated roles. Root manages funds (cold wallet), Agent executes tasks (hot wallet).

```
Root (cold wallet):                    Agent (hot wallet):
1. deposit AWP (S2)                    1. "start working" → Option B
2. allocate to Agent + worknet (S3)    2. bind(rootAddress) → rewards flow to root
3. grantDelegate(agent) if needed      3. pick worknet → start working
```

Note: `bind` already sets the reward path from the agent up to the root. Do not also call
`setRecipient` on the agent — it is redundant.
